## 19. Spoofing
**Definition:** Spoofing is a cyberattack technique where an attacker disguises their identity by falsifying information such as IP addresses, email headers, or caller IDs to trick users into trusting malicious sources.

**Common Spoofing Attacks:**
- **Email Spoofing:** Fake emails appear to be from a legitimate sender (e.g., phishing emails mimicking banks or tech companies).
- **Caller ID Spoofing:** Attackers manipulate phone numbers to impersonate trusted contacts.
- **IP Spoofing:** Fakes the source IP address to bypass security measures or launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**Types of Spoofing Attacks:**
1. **Non-Blind Spoofing:**
   - The attacker is on the same network subnet as the victim.
   - Can see packet sequence numbers and manipulate them to hijack existing sessions.

2. **Blind Spoofing:**
   - The attacker is outside the network and cannot directly see sequence numbers.
   - Sends multiple packets to guess sequence numbers and inject malicious data.

3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:**
   - An attacker intercepts communication between two parties.
   - Can alter, block, or reroute messages without the sender or receiver knowing.

4. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack:**
   - Uses IP spoofing to generate massive traffic floods against a target.
   - Attackers fake source IP addresses, making it harder to trace and block malicious traffic.

**Detection of IP Spoofing:**
- **Network Monitoring:** Look for suspicious packets with internal IP addresses appearing on external network interfaces.
- **Process Accounting Logs:** Compare logs across systems â€” if a spoofed attack succeeds, there will be no corresponding access log entry on the source system.

**Prevention of IP Spoofing:**
- Avoid IP-based authentication â€” Use cryptographic methods instead.
- Configure routers to reject packets with spoofed source addresses (Ingress & Egress filtering).
- Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block private IP addresses on external network interfaces.
- Enable encryption (e.g., VPNs, SSL/TLS) to secure external connections.
