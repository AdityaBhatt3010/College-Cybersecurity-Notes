## 1. Netizen
**Definition:** A netizen (internet + citizen) is an individual who actively participates in online communities, contributes to discussions, and engages in digital activism or content creation.

**Characteristics:**
- Advocates for internet freedom, privacy, and security.
- Engages in social networking, blogging, and digital collaboration.
- Supports ethical digital conduct and combats cyber threats.

**Example:** A cybersecurity enthusiast spreading awareness about phishing scams and safe browsing habits.

---

## 2. Malware and Its Existence
**Definition:** Malware (malicious software) is any program designed to infiltrate, damage, or steal data from a system without user consent.

**Common Sources of Infection:**
- Infected email attachments or links.
- Compromised websites (drive-by downloads).
- Fake software updates.

**Impact:**
- Slows down the system.
- Steals sensitive information.
- Can take full control of a system.

**Example:** Emotet â€” a banking Trojan turned malware delivery service.

---

## 3. Security Hole and Security Patch
**Security Hole:** A vulnerability or weakness in software that cybercriminals can exploit to gain unauthorized access.

**Security Patch:** A fix released by software vendors to close these vulnerabilities and enhance security.

**Best Practices:**
- Regularly update operating systems and software.
- Apply patches as soon as they are available to minimize risk.

**Example:** The EternalBlue exploit in Windows, which led to the WannaCry ransomware outbreak.

---

## 4. Viruses
**Definition:** A virus is a self-replicating malware that attaches itself to legitimate files and spreads when the infected file is executed.

**Types of Viruses:**
- **Boot Sector Virus:** Infects the system boot process.
- **File Infector Virus:** Attaches to executable files.
- **Macro Virus:** Targets Microsoft Office documents.

**Example:** Michelangelo Virus â€” activated on March 6, destroying infected systems.

---

## 5. Worms
**Definition:** Worms are standalone malware that self-replicate and spread across networks without user intervention.

**How They Spread:**
- Exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Sending malicious email attachments.
- Using USB drives or network shares.

**Example:** ILOVEYOU worm infected millions via email attachments.

---

## 6. Trojan Horses
**Definition:** Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software but perform malicious activities once installed.

**Types of Trojans:**
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs):** Give hackers full control over a system.
- **Banking Trojans:** Steal financial data.
- **Dropper Trojans:** Install other malware.

**Example:** Zeus â€” a banking Trojan that stole online banking credentials.

---

## 7. Bot Networks (Botnets)
**Definition:** A botnet is a network of compromised devices (bots) controlled remotely to perform cyber attacks.

**Uses of Botnets:**
- **DDoS Attacks** (e.g., Mirai botnet).
- **Spam Email Campaigns.**
- **Credential Stuffing.**

**Example:** The Mirai botnet caused a major internet outage by attacking Dyn DNS servers.

---

## 8. Social Engineering
**Definition:** Social engineering tricks individuals into revealing sensitive information through deception.

**Common Social Engineering Tactics:**
- **Phishing Emails:** Fake messages prompting users to share passwords.
- **Vishing (Voice Phishing):** Attackers impersonate officials over calls.
- **Smishing (SMS Phishing):** Malicious texts trick users into clicking links.

**Example:** The Twitter Bitcoin scam â€” hackers used social engineering to take over verified accounts.

---

## 9. Avoiding Malware
**Best Practices to Avoid Malware:**
- Install and update antivirus & anti-malware software.
- Enable firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- Avoid clicking on suspicious links and downloading unverified attachments.
- Keep software and operating systems updated.
- Be cautious of phishing emails and fake software updates.

**Example:** Using Windows Defender + Malwarebytes for layered security.
